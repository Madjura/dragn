\section*{Acknowledgment}
I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Siegfried Handschuh for suggesting this topic to me and supervising my thesis. There have been obstacles on the way but his support helped me continue working on this project and ultimately finish it.\\
Further I want to thank Adamantios Koumpis for getting me involved with the Chair and suggesting to me to work there. Without him I would not be where I am today.\\
I want to think all team members, past and present of the Chair of Digital Libraries and Web Information Systems who have been hugely inspirational to me either directly or indirectly through their work.\\
Finally I want to thank Karin Nowotny, Felix Bernasch and Michael Maier for proofreading the thesis and providing feedback.\\
